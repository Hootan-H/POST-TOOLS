# POST-TOOLS
his repository contains a collection of apps and tools I’ve developed for post-production workflows.

Most of these started as in-house tools, built to solve everyday problems in real production environments. Some were developed solely by me, others in collaboration with 
software-developer friends, and more recently with the assistance of AI-based tools to speed up development and experimentation.

The goal of these tools is simple: reduce friction, automate repetitive tasks, and make post-production workflows more efficient and reliable.

I’m now sharing everything here for free, for anyone who may find them useful in their own workflows.

Feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvements are very welcome. If you think something should be added, changed, or expanded, 
feel free to open an issue or reach out — I’m keen to improve future versions and keep these tools evolving alongside real-world needs.



These are apps I’ve developed for internal studio use, and I believe they could be useful to anyone interested. Feel free to download and explore them.
 

FOLDER SYNC: 
Folder Sync is a handy script designed to sync two or more folders. It primarily uses the rsync function and requires a source and a destination folder. Once the sync is complete, it generates a log report file. This is a very lightweight AppleScript app.
 

File-Report app: 
File Report is a macOS-exclusive application that produces comprehensive reports for all files within a selected folder. The report includes essential details such as file name, file path, file size, and MD5 checksum. The app exports this information into an Excel spreadsheet, making it an invaluable tool for DITs and anyone needing to catalogue and verify large volumes of data efficiently.
 

PROJECT STRUCTURE SCRIPT
This is a fast and efficient tool for initialising a new project by creating a standardised folder hierarchy within the project root. This script was developed to maintain consistent folder structures across multiple grading workstations in remote workflows, ensuring seamless collaboration and organisation.
 
Simple 3DLUT Viewer
It is a lightweight and intuitive macOS app designed to visualise 3D Lookup Tables (3D LUTs) in an interactive 3D space. It allows colourists, filmmakers, and visual effects artists to load multiple LUT files (.cube format) and examine their colour transformations as point clouds within a wireframe cube. Interactive 3D view: Rotate the LUT shape by dragging and zoom in/out using pinch gestures or the scroll wheel.
  
EDL/XML/AAF Timeline Inspector
A powerful macOS app designed for video editors, colourists, and post-production professionals to effortlessly load, inspect, and manage timeline data from EDL, Final Cut XML, and AAF files. Quickly visualise shot events with intuitive colour-coded listings, accurate timecode conversions, and detailed inspection panels. Features include drag & drop support, frame rate conversion, comment editing, and exporting clean CSV reports, all wrapped in a sleek, user-friendly interface. Perfect for streamlining your post workflow and gaining clear insights into your project timelines.

Video File Naming Tool
lightweight macOS utility for post-production professionals that quickly creates clean, consistent, industry-standard video filenames. It guides users through structured prompts to select technical parameters such as resolution, mastering codec, colour space, HDR/SDR, frame rate, audio configuration, version, and date, then assembles them into a properly formatted filename and optionally copies it to the clipboard, reducing errors, saving time, and keeping deliveries organised.
